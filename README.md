# a letter to my comrades

*do you ever feel like you have nothing to say as soon as you need to say something? i'll just say what i need to say*

---

there's this idea that has rooted in me. 

it goes:
```
people need other people
```

simple, right? obvious even. i like to get curious about obvious things.

i think of this phrase a lot. i think of the ways i tend to need and be needed by other people. and i think about how this work, this coding thing, can be another way i can practice this little axiom.

this is what i've got so far:

i believe collective liberation is possible. i believe we can liberate ourselves from capitalism, white supremacy, and colonialism. i believe that shaping a new reality is rooted in honoring our shared belonging to each other, to oursleves, and the entire global ecosystem.

people needing other people is a feature of community. it's a feature of liberation. it's is a verb. and we all verb in different ways. coding is one way that i verb towards collective liberation. learning how to wield information technologies towards collective liberation has ignited my imagination and consumed by actions.

i wonder:
- what could it be like for information technologies to be anti-capitalist?
- what would it be like to have anti and decolonial computing?
- what would disabled computing be like?
- what would queer computing unlock?
- what would it be like to truely have computing of and by the people?

i can't wait to find out <3
