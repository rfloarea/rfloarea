# Hey there!

My name is Rowen. I also go by Roe.

Learning is my jam. It tastes like blueberries, peach, and fun!

This is where I host all my code things. I basically consider everything to be a work in progress. I hope you don't mind! 

Let me know what you think of anything you see. I really do love feedback.

My email is: rowen.floarea@proton.me

### Projects In Progress
[dappcord](https://github.com/rfloarea/dappcord)
- This project is a guided learning experience to get my hands working with smart contracts and dapps.

[isalwayslearning](https://github.com/rfloarea/isalwayslearning)
- Not only is this my catchcy catchline, but it's an evolving record of my learning "stuff". It's young and subject to radical changes. But it's super fun to share stuff. So yeah, it's a blog I guess.
