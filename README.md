# Hey there!

Making things is my joy. It's like oranges and the ocean and laughter.

Learning is my jam. It tastes like blueberries, peach, and toast!

I basically consider everything to be a work in progress. I hope you don't mind! 

Let me know what you think of anything you see. I really do love feedback.
