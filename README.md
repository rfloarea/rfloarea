<h1>ðŸ‘‹ Hi, nice to meet you!</h1>
Learning stuff is way better than not learning stuff.<br>
And learning stuff with other people is way better than going at it alone.<br>
<hr>
In general, I'm making things up as I go.<br>
But on here, I'm a bit more focused. Namely, I enjoy thinking about communication and code and writing all that delicious technical jibber jabber that comes along with this stuff we call computers and software.<br>
