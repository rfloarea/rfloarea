# Hey there!

Learning things is my jam.

Making things is my joy.

There's a quote by some guy that goes something like this, "I am not what I am, I am what I do with my hands." I think there's something in there that captures a large portion of what it's like being me. Which is sorta what this file is all about. So I'll allow it just this once.

But on to more interesting things!

Computers are fascinating and terrifying in equal measure. And it seems to me that we don't really know how to handle these new lifeforms. I started studying computers and programming because I hated the relationship I had with them. More to the point, I feared them. So I turned toward that fear and found that there is a lot of good too. There's so much hope and good will flowing into these machines and networks that I get chills just thinking about it. And there are also terrible ways these machines are being used to amplify the power of those who seek to wield it against others in the name of greater powers.

So what now? Where am I on this journey? What is the quality of my relationship with computers at this point?

Well, all I can say right now is, in pursuit of understanding how these machines work and how to really use them, I've noticed changes in *myself*. These changes look like:
- longer attention span
- better reading comprehension
- more willingness to face difficulties and setbacks
- improved creative problem solving skills
In short, a greater attunment to experience itself.

But also, there's a whole shift in worldview that comes too. I've noticed how I take language/concepts from programming and use it to describe and make sense of things happening in my everyday life. Which is sorta wild! How come I can use concepts like concurrency and orthaginality while cooking dinner for my family? Maybe all this stuff has very little to do with computers at all. Maybe it's like that saying about computer science and telescopes. Something like, "computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes". Maybe what we're doing here has much more to do with our relationships and inner experiences than with hardware and networks. Maybe computing is just one big metaphor.
