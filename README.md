# a letter to my comrades

*Do you ever feel like you have nothing to say as soon as you feel the need to say something? I guess I'll just say what I need to say.*

So there's this idea that has rooted in me. 

```
people need other people
```

Simple, right? Obvious even. Since it's obvious, I've needed to get curious about it.

I think of this phrase a lot. I think of the ways I tend to need and be needed by other people. And I think about how this work, this coding thing, can be another way I can practice and explore this little axiom.

## This is what I've learning so far

Collective liberation is possible. We are the only ones who can liberate ourselves and eachother from capitalism, white supremacy, and colonialism. I believe the work of shaping new realities is rooted in honoring our shared belonging to each other, to oursleves, and the entire global ecosystem.

People needing other people is a feature of community. It is a feature of liberation. It's is a verb. And we all verb in different ways. Coding is one (new) way that I verb towards collective liberation. Learning how to wield information technologies towards collective liberation has ignited my imagination and consumed by actions.

I wonder...
- What would it be like for information technologies to be anti-capitalist?
- What would it be like to have anti and decolonial computing?
- What would disabled computing be like?
- What would queer computing unlock?
- What would it be like to truely have computing of and by the people?

I don't know, but I can't wait to find out!
