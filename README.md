# ðŸ‘‹ hey, it's me, rowen

i'm using this space to basically turn my mind inside out for strangers on the internet to see in the hope that we can connect on a human level. yeah, it's scary. but it feels necessary and worth it (necescary? i like that).

## things i think you should know (about me)

1. i'll be using the repo "aLittleQueerCoder" to house all my learnings and sharings. think of it as a more personal look behind all the amazing projects that are sure to populte below.
2. i generally reserve the right to be wrong and ask that any corrections come through genuine conversation. i am very receptive to direct, thoughtful, and relationship-centered feedback.
3. i believe that people need other people. i believe *we* are the solution to our problems.
4. i'm not very smart and not very skilled. but i'm very curious, creative, and generally care about the well beaing of others. which tends to work out pretty good for everyone involved.
5. i don't like to perform "normal". it's draining, exhausting, existentially troubling, and all together just really sucks. also i'm way more fun to be around when i can feel comfortable being myself. it's a win win.
6. life has been lucky and granted me many second chances, space for mistakes, and social priviledges that continue to shape my life. i believe it is without a doubt a responsibility of folks with relative sociopolitical power to do stuff that distributes that power, to use that power as a shield or a weapon or safeharbor or in ways that are still being imagined. i am still being imagined.

There's this little square of a markdown file on my desktop that says:

```
let i = beginner;

while (i < master) {
  learn;
  code;
  share;
}
```

I think it has something to do with the path I'm currently on.
