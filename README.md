# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Rowen

There's this little square of a markdown file on my desktop that says:

```
let i = beginner;

while (i < master) {
  learn;
  code;
  share;
}
```

I think it has something to do with the path I'm currently on.

Diving into web development with every foot I have has been daunting and exhilarating. So much learning. So much coding. So much...well, not much sharing actually.

Which is why this is here!
