# Hey there!

My name is Rowen. I also go by Roe.

Learning is my jam. It tastes like blueberries, peach, and fun!

This is where I host all my code things. I basically consider everything to be a work in progress. I hope you don't mind! 

Let me know what you think of anything you see. I really do love feedback.

My email is: rowen.floarea@proton.me
